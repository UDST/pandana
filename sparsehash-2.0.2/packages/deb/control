Description: hash_map and hash_set classes with minimal space overhead
 This package contains several hash-map implementations, similar
 in API to SGI's hash_map class, but with different performance
 characteristics.  sparse_hash_map uses very little space overhead: 1-2
 bits per entry.  dense_hash_map is typically faster than the default
 SGI STL implementation.  This package also includes hash-set analogues
 of these classes.
