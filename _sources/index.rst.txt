Pandana
=======

Pandana is a neologism representing Pandas Network Analysis.

Pandana performs hundreds of thousands of network queries in under a second
(for walking-scale distances) using a Pandas-like API.  The computations are
parallelized for use on multi-core computers using an underlying C
library.
