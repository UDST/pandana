Pandana
=======

Pandana is a Python library for network analysis that uses `contraction hierarchies <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contraction_hierarchies>`_ to calculate super-fast travel accessibility metrics and shortest paths. The numerical code is in C++.

v0.6.1, released March 17, 2021.


Acknowledgments
---------------

Pandana was created by Fletcher Foti, with subsequent contributions from Matt Davis, Federico Fernandez, Sam Maurer, and others. Sam Maurer is currently the lead maintainer. Pandana relies on contraction hierarchy code from Dennis Luxen and his `OSRM project <https://github.com/DennisOSRM/Project-OSRM>`_.

A `paper on Pandana <http://onlinepubs.trb.org/onlinepubs/conferences/2012/4thITM/Papers-A/0117-000062.pdf>`_
was presented at the Transportation Research Board Annual Conference in 2012. Please cite this paper when referring to the methodology implemented by this library.
