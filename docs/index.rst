Pandana
=======

For starters, Pandana stands for Pandas Network Analysis.

Pandana performs hundreds of thousands of network queries in under a second
(for walking-scale distances) using a Pandas-like API.  The computations are
 then parallelized for use on multi-core computers using an underlying C
 library.
