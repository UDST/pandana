name: Build-wheels

# This workflow builds "wheels", which are the binary package installers hosted on PyPI.
# GitHub Actions is super helpful here because each one needs to be compiled in its own
# target environment. The wheel files are saved as artifacts, which you can download from
# the GitHub website. Wheels should be uploaded manually to PyPI -- see CONTRIBUTING.md.

# The Linux wheels cannot be generated using `ubuntu-latest` because they require a
# special Docker image to provide cross-Linux compatibility. There are at least a couple
# of third-party actions set up using the official image; we could switch to another if
# this ever breaks.
