    Create the transportation network in the city.  Typical data would be

    Parameters
    ----------
    node_x : Pandas Series, float
        Defines the x attribute for nodes in the network (e.g. longitude)
    node_y : Pandas Series, float
        Defines the y attribute for nodes in the network (e.g. latitude)
        This param and the one above should have the *same* index which
        should be the node_ids that are referred to in the edges below.
    edge_from : Pandas Series, int
        Defines the node id that begins an edge - should refer to the index
        of the two series objects above
    edge_to : Pandas Series, int
        Defines the node id that ends an edge - should refer to the index
        of the two series objects above
    edge_weights : Pandas DataFrame, all floats
        Specifies one or more *impedances* on the network which define the
        distances between nodes.  Multiple impedances can be used to
        capture travel times at different times of day, for instance
    twoway : boolean, optional
        Whether the edges in this network are two way edges or one way (
        where the one direction is directed from the from node to the to
        node). If twoway = True, it is assumed that the from and to id in the
        edge table occurs once and that travel can occur in both directions
        on the single edge record. Pandana will internally flip and append
        the from and to ids to the original edges to create a two direction
        network. If twoway = False, it is assumed that travel can only occur
        in the explicit direction indicated by the from and to id in the edge
        table.

        node_ids : Pandas Series, int

            A series which represents some variable defined in urban space.
            It could be the location of buildings, or the income of all
            households - just about anything can be aggregated using the
            network queries provided here and this provides the api to set

            Name the variable.  This is optional in the sense that if you don't
            specify it, the default name will be used.  Since the same
            default name is used by aggregate on this object, you can

        Parameters
        ----------
        distance : float
            The maximum distance to look for pois. This will usually be a
            distance unit in meters however if you have customized the
            impedance this could be in other units such as utility or time
            etc.
        category : string
            The name of the category of poi to look for
        num_pois : int
            The number of pois to look for, this also sets the number of
            columns in the DataFrame that gets returned

            customized the impedance this could be in other units such as
            utility or time etc.
        imp_name : string, optional
            The impedance name to use for the aggregation on this network.
            Must be one of the impedance names passed in the constructor of
            this object.  If not specified, there must be only one impedance
            passed in the constructor, which will be used.
        include_poi_ids : bool, optional
            If this flag is set to true, the call will add columns to the
            return DataFrame - instead of just returning the distance for
            the nth POI, it will also return the id of that POI.  The names

        -------
        d : Pandas DataFrame
            Like aggregate, this series has an index of all the node ids for
            the network.  Unlike aggregate, this method returns a dataframe
            with the number of columns equal to the distances to the Nth
            closest poi.  For instance, if you ask for the 10 closest poi to
            each node, column d[1] wil be the distance to the 1st closest poi
            of that category while column d[2] will be the distance to the 2nd
            closest poi, and so on.
